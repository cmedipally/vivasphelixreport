# SharePoint & Viva Content Update Strategy
## Executive Brief - Product Refresh Preparation

**Date:** January 21, 2026
**Prepared for:** Content Strategy & Leadership Team

---

## The Challenge

With major SharePoint and Viva product refreshes launching in 30 days, our documentation is critically outdated:

- **8,865 total assets** analyzed
- **87% of content over 1 year old** (7,689 pages)
- **Average age: 3+ years** since last review
- **CSAT score: 47/100** (below satisfactory)

**The Risk:** Users will reference outdated documentation during the new product launch, leading to confusion, support escalations, and poor adoption.

---

## The Solution: Targeted 4-Tier Approach

We can't update everything. Instead, focus on **297 high-impact pages (3.3% of content)** that reach **55% of users**.

### Prioritization Matrix

| Tier | Pages | Traffic Impact | Avg Age | Focus | Timeline |
|------|-------|----------------|---------|-------|----------|
| **Tier 1: Critical** | 50 | 49.6% | 409 days | High-traffic pages | Weeks 1-2 |
| **Tier 2: Technical** | 50 | 0.5% | 6 years | IT Pro/Admin content | Weeks 3-4 |
| **Tier 3: Fix Pain** | 50 | 0.9% | 623 days | 0-CSAT pages | Week 5 |
| **Tier 4: Strategic** | 147 | 4.2% | 1,621 days | Entry points | Week 6 |
| **Total** | **297** | **55%** | — | — | **6 weeks** |

---

## Tier 1: Critical Priority (DO THIS FIRST)

**50 pages = 50% of all traffic**

### Top 10 Must-Update Pages

| Page | Monthly Views | Age (days) | CSAT | Why Critical |
|------|--------------|------------|------|--------------|
| Sign in to SharePoint | 12.9M | 288 | 43 | #1 entry point, auth changes |
| Sharing files, folders, list items | 4.1M | 461 | 51 | Core collaboration workflow |
| Create modern pages | 2.6M | 468 | 52 | UI completely redesigned |
| Troubleshooting SharePoint | 2.0M | 260 | 42 | Support escalation source |
| What is a team site? | 1.9M | 275 | 59 | Fundamental concept |
| List column types | 1.2M | 504 | 42 | Core feature |
| View/edit page details | 1.2M | 391 | 44 | Common task |
| Get started with SharePoint | 1.2M | 349 | 48 | New user onboarding |
| Create and share news | 1.1M | 439 | 58 | Modern communication |
| SharePoint help hub | 848K | 414 | 46 | Navigation central |

### Content Focus Areas (Tier 1)
1. **Authentication & Sign-in** - New identity flows
2. **Sharing & Collaboration** - Permission model changes
3. **Modern Pages & Sites** - Complete UI refresh
4. **Lists & Libraries** - Enhanced capabilities
5. **File Management** - Sync and access workflows

**Effort:** 2-3 weeks | 3-4 writers | **ROI: 50% of users reached**

---

## Tier 2: Technical Priority

**50 pages for IT Pros & Admins** - Very stale (avg 6 years old)

### Why This Matters
- Lower traffic, but **critical for enterprise deployments**
- Outdated admin guidance = **failed implementations**
- IT decision-makers reference these for planning

### Content Types
- SharePoint Server on-premises administration
- PowerShell cmdlet references (2,251 pages total)
- Hybrid configuration guides
- Migration and upgrade documentation

**Effort:** 2-3 weeks | 2 writers | **ROI: Prevent enterprise escalations**

---

## Tier 3: User Satisfaction Priority

**50 pages with 0 CSAT scores** despite reasonable traffic

### The Problem
Users are **actively dissatisfied** with these pages:
- Missing critical information
- Outdated procedures that don't work
- Broken workflows

### Examples

| Page | CSAT | Monthly Views | Issue |
|------|------|---------------|-------|
| Conditional access policy | 0 | 57K | Configuration doesn't match product |
| Quick start guide | 0 | 53K | Steps are wrong |
| Files open as read-only | 0 | 42K | Solution doesn't work |
| Manage search schema | 0 | 30K | UI completely changed |

**Effort:** 1-2 weeks | 2 writers | **ROI: Fix biggest pain points, reduce support tickets**

---

## Tier 4: Strategic Priority

**147 "Get Started" and landing pages** - Set user expectations

### Why Strategic?
- **First impression** pages (onboarding, product overviews)
- **Navigation hubs** (guide feature discovery)
- **Marketing alignment** (support launch messaging)

### Examples
- "Get started with SharePoint" - 1.2M views
- "What is SharePoint?" - 386K views
- Product landing pages and topic hubs

**Effort:** 3-4 weeks | 2-3 writers | **ROI: Cohesive launch experience**
