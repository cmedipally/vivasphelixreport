Subject: SharePoint & Viva Content Analysis - Interactive Dashboard

Hi Team,

I've created an interactive dashboard to help us prepare for the upcoming SharePoint and Viva product refresh (launching in 30 days).

📊 WHAT'S INSIDE:
- Analysis of 8,865 documentation assets
- 4-tier prioritization framework (297 pages to update)
- Visual breakdowns by theme, content type, product, platform
- Focus on high-traffic, stale, or low-CSAT content

🚀 HOW TO ACCESS:
1. Open the attached file: SharePoint_Viva_Interactive_Dashboard.html
2. Works in any browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
3. No login required, works offline

📋 WHAT YOU CAN DO:
- View priority tiers (click to expand each section)
- See top 10 pages that need updating (13M+ views on #1 page!)
- Explore content distribution by theme, type, freshness
- Review breakdown by product area and writers
- Access export file information

🎯 KEY FINDINGS:
✓ 87% of content is over 1 year old
✓ Top 50 pages capture 50% of all traffic
✓ 50 pages have 0 CSAT scores (user pain points)
✓ Updating 297 pages will reach 55% of users

📁 DATA FILES:
All CSV files are available at: C:\Users\cmedipally\
- Tier1_Critical_Update.csv (50 pages)
- Tier2_High_Priority.csv (50 pages)
- Tier3_Low_CSAT.csv (50 pages)
- Tier4_Strategic.csv (147 pages)
- Top100_Overall_Priorities.csv (master list)

💡 COMING SOON:
I'm also setting up an interactive Claude for Work project where you can ask questions about the data. More details to follow!
